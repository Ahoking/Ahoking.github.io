<h1>IT assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Name: Rui(Jerry) Chen</p>
<p>Student number: s3781948</p>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:ahokingbaka@gmail.com">ahokingbaka@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Nationality: Born in China but lived in Australia long enough to become an Australian citizen.</p>
<p>Education to date: Year 12 graduate</p>
<p>Language: Chinese, English and Japanese. (None of these can be considered &lsquo;fluent&rsquo; though.)</p>
<p>Interest: Anime, Games, Manga, Piano, Rubik&rsquo;s cube and most importantly Being autistic.</p>
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I am interested in programming and I did IT and programming in VCE. Sadly my teacher only bothered to teach us visual basic and only the very basic concepts programming so my experience is limited.</p>
<p>I loved to use command to create weird mechanisms in Minecraft and the essence of that resembles to programming so I gained interest in that.</p>
<p>I came to RMIT because I am fake Asian and I can&rsquo;t do maths therefore Melbourne Uni doesn&rsquo;t want me. Also the career teacher at my high school said RMIT is closer to your home so you should consider it which I did commit.</p>
<p>I expected to learn most about coding and whatever other stuff is in the course.</p>

<p>From what I have understand from the job description, it requires java programming and testing as well as other problem solving with coding and servers etc. As I am learning java and oracle in this course (which were mentioned in the job requirement) I thought it would fit in pretty well. Also the salary looks not bad to me so that is very appealing too.</p>
<p>The skills required for the job involves java coding, various of things that I have never heard of and the communication ability with Homines sapientes. However, I am only at beginner&rsquo;s level in coding and have close to zero experience for the other requirements. To obtain the coding skill, I am obviously taking the university course as well as self studying online. For the other skills I might consider after university as I am not sure if they will be covered in the future course I take, but if not I will try use online resources to obtain the skills. I have strong opposition with the last requirement though so hopefully I will be good enough on other skills to make up for that.</p>

<p>The result of these tests mean nothing to me because I know they are not suppose to be 100% correct and is not everything about me. They also tend to use vague description to make people feel that they are legit but they are actually not as I was taught by my psychology teacher in high school. If I was not asked by the assessment to do the test I would never waste a second on this type of test.</p>
<p>These result would not really influence me as they don&rsquo;t mean much to me and I will probably forget about them before I even form a team. (This answers the third question as well)</p>
<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A chord sight-reading practice game designed for beginner piano players like myself.</p>
<p>It may contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>a teaching mode where it just shows the player the chord on the music score,</li>
<li>a practice mode where it can show you the chord when you get the current one right, it shows a new one,</li>
<li>and a challenge mode where the player need to get as many chord right as possible in a certain time frame.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>For what I am passionate about, I don&rsquo;t really have an idea because I feel like I just want to do what people give me instead of starting something myself. Even though I have a lot of different hobbies, I was never a master in any of them so I would avoid the word passionate as I am not at that level. After the above thinking process, what comes into my mind is to make a program that is made for beginner so that I can use it as a guide toward a higher level. As I am in my second year of self-studying piano, I found that reading the chords is taking me a very long time so I would like to make a chord sight-reading trainer to help myself on that. In fact, I made a note sight-reading game in visual basic for my VCE software development SAT, I thought this would be a start to move on to a harder project.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This project is a sight-reading training and challenge game for piano. It will have an UI that shows different chords on a music score and buttons arranged like a piano keyboard. It should be able to display chord in both treble clef and bass clef as those clef display same notes differently on the music score. The clef might be changed with a set of radio button or a slider.</p>
<p>It will contain three different modes:</p>
<p>Teaching mode &ndash; This mode should show three to four different notes on the music score and highlight the corresponding keys on the keyboard in green, which makes it obvious how the chord looks like so the player can remember it as they go through the different chords.</p>
<p>Practice mode &ndash; This mode should show three to four different notes on the music score. When the player hits one of the corresponding keys, it will highlight the key in green. Similarly, if the player hit a wrong note, it should highlight the key in red to mark the wrong key that has been played so the player can reconsider what key to hit. After the player has clicked on all of the corresponding key the program should show a new set of notes to the player to start over the learning process.</p>
<p>Challenge mode &ndash; This mode will have the similar function as practice mode, such as showing chords and highlighting right and wrong notes, but it will also have a countdown timer that is set to a timeframe somewhere between a minute to three minute. The player will have to try to get as many right answers with less mistakes within the time frame, which result in a final score they get after the timer is stopped.</p>
<p>Some unnecessary but interesting function might be:</p>
<p>- Whenever the key is pressed, play the corresponding piano sound file so it would be a more immersive experience for the player.</p>
<p>- Play all of the three to four sound file together when each chord has been completed which serves the same purpose as the idea above.</p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>As I am taking introduction to programming and we use Java in the course, I think I will use Java to make the program. The only hardware that is really needed is probably just my laptop. If I decided to add sound files into the program I might need to find them on the internet or even record them myself so a piano might be also needed.</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>I already have some logic of the code as I have done a note sight-reading game in Visual Basic but there are still a lot of logic and code to be considered. Some of the java stuff that I know exist but don&rsquo;t know how to do include how to make buttons &amp; radio buttons &amp; sliders, how to set timers, how to import pictures and some lots of other mechanics. Currently my Java skill is very limited but it should improve as I get into the course more so it should be pretty feasible.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, for people who use it and myself might become better at sight-reading piano scores and if it is good enough I might even be able to sell the program for some extra income. But beside that it does not really change the society that much nor does it solve problems like global warming.</p>
